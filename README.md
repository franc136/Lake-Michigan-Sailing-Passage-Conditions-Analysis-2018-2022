## Introduction

The following is a case study analyzing weather buoy data provided by NOAA, to determine the best time to make a sailing passage on Lake Michigan from Chicago, IL to Mackinac Island, MI. The data in this project looks at NOAA data that was pulled from 2018-2022 from two separate weather buoys. The south buoy (no. 45007) is located in the open water at the south end of Lake Michigan, approximately 43 nautical miles east-southeast of Milwaukee, WI. The north buoy (no. 45002) is located in the open water at the north end of Lake Michigan, approximately halfway between North Manitou Island, MI, and Washington Island, WI. There are no open water buoys located in the middle portion of Lake Michigan, so the two buoy data sets were analyzed to predict the best time to make a passage based on wind direction, wave height, wind speed, occurrences of small craft advisories, and temperature.
